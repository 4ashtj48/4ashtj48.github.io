## Documentation.md

For this assessment, I have decided to create a portfolio, which sets out to solve the issue of self- promotion and to provide a platform that I can update as I gain skills, displaying and documenting the work that I have complete over the course of university, possibly even after. A portfolio seemed a good place to start to learn more CSS techniques as I am still being very experimental and finding techniques that work for me and I can use as transferable skills to other websites.
One thing I have picked up whilst exploring image positioning which I have used on all of the main pages is the CSS Flexbox layout module, using columns and rows to order to place the containers horizontally or vertically, which made the transition to responsive pages a lot easier to deal with.

## Colour choices

The colour scheme of the site stems from looking into other tech company logo’s, a lot of them seem to incorporate blue and white, such as Samsung, IBM, Intel, HP and many other examples so I based my initial idea using this as a stencil to the overarching ‘look’ of the website.
I looked further into colour psychology and according to 99designs, blue is used in technology companies as it indicates steadfastness and security, I also wanted to add a turquoise layer, knowing that I needed some contrast if blue was going to be appearing in my backgrounds. Turquoise, meaning open communication and clarity of thought, which I thought works nicely in tandem with the dark blue displayed.
I originally had a smooth, dark blue as a background for the sites, I felt like it required some sort of effect or sheen on it, I found a few designs I liked the look of from trianglify.io which generates geometric patterns to your colour design, however I settled on a repeating pattern, which I chose, simply, as it is very close to my favourite jumper design and thought it added a slightly more personal touch to the portfolio, which I am marketing myself on.

## GDPR

In terms of conforming to regulations, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), I have made sure that what kinds of information gathered, and how it is collected, used and maintained is included within a privacy policy, as well as an email address to contact to see what information has been collected and to remove their data. Although the form does not currently collect information, if I wanted to have the contact form to go live, I would need to have a privacy policy in place as a legal obligation.
Also included under the GDPR heading is ‘Cookie law’ which now legally requires websites to show which Cookies as well as which category they belong to, are being collected. Consent is required for non-essential cookies, which is why I have included a cookie consent pop-up when first opening the site. I have used ‘termly.io’ recommended by peers on the course as it seems to provide the service for of identifying and constructing policies to cover small businesses.
Evaluation

## Evaluation

In terms of tackling the problem of self promotion, I now have a platform which I can expand on, showing work examples as I progress through university. The current design, although simple, I am happy with as it demonstrates the skills we have gone over in class, as well as indepentantly finding other means of solving issues.
The basic functionality of the site is there, however I would not use it until I had further developed more skills, such as being able to use a 'hamburger menu' and other interactive pieces. Compared to professional portfolio's, I consider my own to be in an embryonic stage of development, as although it houses an 'about me' and 'skills' section, I would further want to display my work, with written testomonials, higher quality images and finally, a working contact form.

I found the most difficult hurdle when creating the website is getting to grips with margins and padding, It took a lot of testing before I realised exactly what they did do each container or image. Spacing is something I struggled with in the first assignment and overall I have largely improved on this, I resolved an issue in the contact page where the header text and the contact form were conflicting, and split them into two seoerate sections and styled into a column.

One thing I would do differently if I repeated this assessment would be to use a 'mobile first' approach to solve responsiveness, and although I managed to use styling to get around a few issues, I can see the merit in styling for mobile screens first as designing the page is objectively harder, before moving onto the desktop and tablet sizes.
Although my own website only uses one media query at 550px to scale the website to a mobile screen, it demonstrates the ability to make a responsive website as it would only be more of the same styling at different values up to a point. I tested all of my pages through using the inspect option via Google chrome and toggled between the two sizes, selecting elements to change and test in the browser. Finally, to finish testing, I used my own mobile as well as asking a few friends to view the site to making sure it looked presentable.

Lastly, I am very happy now using Github to version control, I feel like using and commiting regularly and labeling each change proved very useful, keeping track of the changes over the project, allowing me to see changes I had made earlier in the programme for styling.
Over all I have learnt a lot creating this website, putting a lot of skills from the lessons to practical use as well as going beyond sorting spacing issues, using version control and creating a responsive site, giving me valuable experience going forward when it comes to making future websites.
