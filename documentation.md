For this assessment, I have decided to create a portfolio, which sets out to solve the issue of self- promotion and to provide a platform that I can update as I gain skills, displaying and documenting the work that I have complete over the course of university, possibly even after. A portfolio seemed a good place to start to learn more CSS techniques as I am still being very experimental and finding techniques that work for me and I can use as transferable skills to other websites.
One thing I have picked up whilst exploring image positioning which I have used on all of the main pages is the CSS Flexbox layout module, using columns and rows to order to place the <div> containers horizontally or vertically, which made the transition to responsive pages a lot easier to deal with.

Colour Choices
The colour scheme of the site stems from looking into other tech company logo’s, a lot of them seem to incorporate blue and white, such as Samsung, IBM, Intel, HP and many other examples so I based my initial idea using this as a stencil to the overarching ‘look’ of the website.
I looked further into colour psychology and according to 99designs, blue is used in technology companies as it indicates steadfastness and security, I also wanted to add a turquoise layer, knowing that I needed some contrast if blue was going to be appearing in my backgrounds. Turquoise, meaning open communication and clarity of thought, which I thought works nicely in tandem with the dark blue displayed.
I originally had a smooth, dark blue as a background for the sites, I felt like it required some sort of effect or sheen on it, I found a few designs I liked the look of from trianglify.io which generates geometric patterns to your colour design, however I settled on a repeating pattern, which I chose, simply, as it is very close to my favourite jumper design and thought it added a slightly more personal touch to the portfolio, which I am marketing myself on.

GDPR
In terms of conforming to regulations, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), I have made sure that what kinds of information gathered, and how it is collected, used and maintained is included within a privacy policy, as well as an email address to contact to see what information has been collected and to remove their data. Although the form does not currently collect information, if I wanted to have the contact form to go live, I would need to have a privacy policy in place as a legal obligation.
Also included under the GDPR heading is ‘Cookie law’ which now legally requires websites to show which Cookies as well as which category they belong to, are being collected. Consent is required for non-essential cookies, which is why I have included a cookie consent pop-up when first opening the site. I have used ‘termly.io’ recommended by peers on the course as it seems to provide the service for of identifying and constructing policies to cover small businesses.
