            Based in Salisbury, Wiltshire. <br /><br />
            I am currently in my first year studing Computing at Solent
            University. <br />
            Current modules; Intro to computer systems, Intro to databases,
            Intro to networks. Object oriented Programming/JAVA OOP, Web
            technologies & Cyber security essentials.<br /><br />

            I have always held an interest in futurology, especially in the form
            of technological advances. After working in an office environment
            where many out-dated and inefficient methods were prevelent, I
            decided I needed to get back into education and learn how to develop
            my own solutions.<br />
            <br />
            I regularly participate in online and in-store MTG tournaments, host
            and play in regular D&D campaigns and enjoy travelling the world,
            experiencing different cultures.
